    Recursive dict merge. Inspired by :meth:``dict.update()``, instead of
    updating only top-level keys, dict_merge recurses down into dicts nested
    to an arbitrary depth, updating keys. The ``merge_dct`` is merged into
    ``dct``.

    This version will return a copy of the dictionary and leave the original
    arguments untouched.

    The optional argument ``add_keys``, determines whether keys which are
    present in ``merge_dict`` but not ``dct`` should be included in the
    new dict.

    Args:
        dct (dict) onto which the merge is executed
        merge_dct (dict): dct merged into dct
        add_keys (bool): whether to add new keys

    Returns:
        dict: updated dict
