    # TODO:
    # This mapping is not super straightforward. It could use the following improvements:
    # * Registry keys need to pull the path apart from the key name, I believe. Need to investigate with Splunk
    # * Need to validate that the src and dest aliases are working
    # * Need to add in the static attributes, like the `object_category` field
    # * Need to verify "software" == "inventory"
    # * Need to figure out network traffic when it's for web URLs
    # * Hashes are kind of hacky, just hardcoded. Probably needs to be a regex
