## Introduction

### What is STIX?

Structured Threat Information eXpression (STIXâ„¢) is a language and serialization format that organizations can use to exchange cyber threat intelligence (CTI). CTI is represented with objects and descriptive relationships and stored as JSON for machine readability.

STIX delivers a consistent and machine-readable way to enable collaborative threat analysis, automated threat exchange, automated detection and response, and more.

To learn more about STIX, see the following references:

- [Introduction to STIX](https://oasis-open.github.io/cti-documentation/stix/intro)

### What is STIX-SHIFTER?

STIX-shifter is an open source python library allowing software to connect to products that house data repositories by using `STIX Patterning`, and return results as `STIX Observations`.

### What is STIX Patterning? What are STIX Observations?

STIX 2 Patterning is a part of STIX that deals with the "matching things" part of STIX, which is an integral component of STIX Indicators.

##### An example of a STIX pattern:

`[url:value = 'http://www.testaddress.com'] OR [ipv4-addr:value = '192.168.122.84']`

A STIX Observation is the `observed-data` STIX Domain Object (SDO). You can think of this as a row of data that is returned from a search triggered by the STIX pattern, and can represent an indicator of compromise. Each observation contains one or more STIX Cyber observable Objects (SCO) which in turn has one or more properties associated to the data returned from the search. 

##### An example of a STIX Observation:

```json
{
  "id": "observed-data--cf2c58dc-200e-49e0-b6f7-e1997cccf707",
  "type": "observed-data",
  "created_by_ref": "identity--3532c56d-ea72-48be-a2ad-1a53f4c9c6d8",
  "objects": {
    "0": {
      "type": "network-traffic",
      "src_port": 567,
      "dst_port": 102,
      "src_ref": "1",
      "dst_ref": "2"
    },
    "1": {
      "type": "ipv4-addr",
      "value": "192.168.122.84"
    },
    "2": {
      "type": "ipv4-addr",
      "value": "127.0.0.1"
    },
    "3": {
      "type": "url",
      "value": "www.testaddress.com"
    }
  }
}
```

As anyone with experience in data science will tell you, the cleansing and normalizing of the data across domains, is one of the largest hurdles to overcome with attempting to build cross-platform security analytics. This is one of the barriers we are attempting to break down with STIX Shifter.

### This sounds like Sigma, I already have that

[Sigma](https://github.com/Neo23x0/sigma) and STIX Patterning have goals that are related, but at the end of the day has slightly different scopes. While Sigma seeks to be "for log files what Snort is for network traffic and YARA is for files", STIX Patterning's goal is to encompass _all three_ fundamental security data source types - network, file, and log - and do so simultaneously, allowing you to create complex queries and analytics that span domains. As such, so does STIX Shifter. It is critical to be able to create search patterns that span SIEM, Endpoint, Network, and File levels, in order to detect the complex patterns used in modern campaigns.

### What is a STIX-SHIFTER connector?

A STIX-shifter connector is a module inside Stix-Shifter library that implements an interface for:

- data source query and result set translation
- data source communication

Developing a new connector expands on the data sources that STIX-shifter can support.

The combination of translation and transmission functions allows for a single STIX pattern to generate a native query for each supported data source. Each query is run, and the results are translated back into STIX objects; allowing for a uniform presentation of data.

The objective is to have all the security data, regardless of the data source to look and behave the same.

### Why would I want to use this?

You might want to use this library and contribute to development, if any of the following are true:

- You are a vendor or project owner who wants to add some form of query or enrichment functions to your product capabilities
- You are an end user and want to have a way to script searches and/or queries as part of your orchestration flow
- You are a vendor or project owner who has data that can be made available, and you want to contribute a connector
- You just want to help make the world a safer place!

Take a look at the [**currently available connectors**](CONNECTORS.md).


## How to use

### Prerequisites

Python 3.8 or greater is required to use stix-shifter.

Stix-shifter provides several functions: `translate` and `transmit` are the primary functions, `execute` offers a way to test the complete stix-shifter flow.

1. [**Translate**](#translate)

   The `translate` command converts STIX patterns into data source queries (in whatever query language the data source might use) and translates data source results (in JSON format) into bundled STIX observation objects.

2. [**Transmit**](#transmit)

   The `transmit` command allows stix-shifter to connect with products that house repositories of cybersecurity data. Connection and authentication credentials are passed to the data source APIs where stix-shifter can make calls to ping the data source, make queries, delete queries, check query status, and fetch query results.

3. [**Execute**](#execute)

   The translation and transmission functions can work in sequence by using the `execute` command from the CLI.

## Translate

### CLI Arguments

| Argument | Description | Accepted Input |
| -------- | ------------ | --------------- |
| TRANSLATION KEYWORD | The keyword specifiying a function will be used to translate queries and results. | `translate` |
| MODULE NAME | The name of the connector being used. This is the module directory name as it appears in [stix_shifter_modules](../stix_shifter_modules). If the connector supports multiple dialects, then by default a query will be generated for each one. You may specifiy a specific dialect by adding `:<DIALECT>` directly after the module name | The connector module name with an optional `:<DIALECT>` |
| TRANSLATION DATA TYPE | The type of data you wish to translate. This will be `query` for translating STIX patterns to native queries and `results` for translating data source results to STIX.  | `query` or `results` |
| STIX IDENTITY OBJECT | This is an object that represents the data source being queried and is inserted into the results bundle of STIX objects. An empty object `"{}"` may be used for the query translation. This must be wrapped in quotes to use with the CLI. | A stringified STIX identity object |
| TRANSLATION DATA | This is the STIX pattern for query translation and a list of JSON results for results translation. This must be wrapped in quote to use with the CLI. | A stringified STIX pattern or list of JSON data |
| OPTIONS | An object of optional parameters. This must be wrapped in quotes to use with the CLI. | A stringified object of options |

#### CLI Options

These are general translation options defined in [`config.json`](../stix_shifter_modules/config.json) that can apply to all connectors but may be overwritten by individual modules.

| Option | Translation Data Type | Description | Accepted Values |
| ------ | --------------------- | ----------- | -------------- |
| result_limit | query | The max number of results that can be returned from a query. This value is generally included in translated queries before getting sent to the data source's API query call. The default is `10000` | A number between `1` and `500000` |
| time_range | query | A default time range, in minutes, applied to the translated query when no `START STOP` qualifier is present in the STIX pattern. As an example, this would be the `last x minutes` in a SQL query. The default is `5` | A number between `1` and `10000` |
| dialects | query | Dialects to be used for pattern translation. This will determine what `from_stix_map.json` files will be used. | A list of one or more dialect strings supported by the connector |
| validate_pattern | query | Specifies if pattern validation is run during the query translation call. This can catch errors in the submitted STIX pattern that would otherwise raise exceptions during translation. | `true` or `false` |
| unmapped_fallback | results | If set to `true`, any results data returned, that is not specifired in the to-STIX mapping, will be included in the results in the following STIX object:property format `x-<MODULE NAME>:<NATIVE DATA FIELD>`. The default is `false` | `true` or `false` |
| stix_2.1 | results | Results are returned as STIX 2.0 objects by default. Setting this option will return results in STIX 2.1 format. The default is `false` | `true` or `false` |


### 1. Translate a STIX pattern to a native data source query

#### INPUT: STIX 2 pattern

```
# STIX Pattern:
"[url:value = 'http://www.testaddress.com'] OR [ipv4-addr:value = '192.168.122.84']"
```

#### OUTPUT: Native data source query

```
# Translated Query (using SQL as an example):
"SELECT * FROM tableName WHERE (Url = 'http://www.testaddress.com')
OR
((SourceIpV4 = '192.168.122.84' OR DestinationIpV4 = '192.168.122.84'))"
```

### CLI Command

Open a terminal and navigate to your python 3 environment. Translation of a **query** is called in the format of:

`stix-shifter translate <MODULE NAME> query "<STIX IDENTITY OBJECT>" "<STIX PATTERN>" "<OPTIONS>"`

Alternatively, you can run the CLI commands from the source. Open a terminal and navigate to the stix-shifter root directory. Translation of a **query** is called in the format of:

`python main.py translate <MODULE NAME> query "<STIX IDENTITY OBJECT>" "<STIX PATTERN>" "<OPTIONS>"`

The module name refers to the name of the folder in stix-shifter that contains the connector code. The current module names can be found in the [Available Connectors](CONNECTORS.md) table. The STIX identity object is only used when translating data source results into STIX, so it can be passed in as an empty object for query translation calls.

Using the Qradar connector as an example:

`python main.py translate qradar query "{}" "[url:value = 'http://www.testaddress.com'] OR [ipv4-addr:value = '192.168.122.84']"`

### Pattern translation using an input file

Create a text file with the pattern you wish to translate. The file can be used in the query translation call using standard input.

_pattern.txt_
```
[network-traffic:src_ref.value = '127.0.0.1'] OR [ipv4-addr:value = '0.0.0.0']
```

`python main.py translate qradar query '{}' '' < /path/to/file/pattern.txt`

### 2. Translate a JSON data source query result to a STIX 2.0 bundle of observable objects

#### INPUT: JSON data source query result

```
# Datasource results (in JSON format):
[
    {
        "SourcePort": 567,
        "DestinationPort": 102,
        "SourceIpV4": "192.168.122.84",
        "DestinationIpV4": "127.0.0.1",
        "Url": "www.testaddress.com"
    }
]
```

#### OUTPUT: STIX 2.0 bundle of observable objects

```
# STIX Observables
{
    "type": "bundle",
    "id": "bundle--2042a6e9-7f34-4a03-a745-502e358594c3",
    "spec_version": "2.0",
    "objects": [
        {
            "type": "identity",
            "id": "identity--3532c56d-ea72-48be-a2ad-1a53f4c9c6d8",
            "name": "YourDataSource",
            "identity_class": "events"
        },
        {
            "id": "observed-data--cf2c58dc-200e-49e0-b6f7-e1997cccf707",
            "type": "observed-data",
            "created_by_ref": "identity--3532c56d-ea72-48be-a2ad-1a53f4c9c6d8",
            "objects": {
                "0": {
                    "type": "network-traffic",
                    "src_port": 567,
                    "dst_port": 102,
                    "src_ref": "1",
                    "dst_ref": "2"
                },
                "1": {
                    "type": "ipv4-addr",
                    "value": "192.168.122.84"
                },
                "2": {
                    "type": "ipv4-addr",
                    "value": "127.0.0.1"
                },
                "3": {
                    "type": "url",
                    "value": "www.testaddress.com"
                }
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

### CLI Command

Open a terminal and navigate to your python 3 environment. Translation of a **results** is called in the format of:

`stix-shifter translate <MODULE NAME> result '<STIX IDENTITY OBJECT>' '<LIST OF JSON RESULTS>'`

Alternatively, you can run the CLI commands from the source. Open a terminal and navigate to the stix-shifter root directory. Translation of **results** is called in the format of:

`python main.py translate <MODULE NAME> result '<STIX IDENTITY OBJECT>' '<LIST OF JSON RESULTS>'`

The module name refers to the name of the folder in stix-shifter that contains the connector code. The current module names can be found in the [Available Connectors](CONNECTORS.md) table. The STIX Identity object represents the data source and is passed in to allow stix-shifter to create a reference between the data source and the generated STIX observed objects.

Using the QRadar connector as an example:

```
python main.py translate qradar results \
'{"type": "identity", "id": "identity--3532c56d-ea72-48be-a2ad-1a53f4c9c6d3", "name": "QRadar", "identity_class": "events"}' \
'[{"sourceip": "192.0.2.0", "filename": "someFile.exe", "sourceport": "0123", "username": "root"}]'
```

### Translating results into STIX 2.1

By default, JSON results are translated into STIX 2.0. To return STIX 2.1 results include `'{"stix_2.1": true}'` in the CLI command

```
python main.py translate qradar results \
'{"type": "identity", "id": "identity--3532c56d-ea72-48be-a2ad-1a53f4c9c6d3", "name": "QRadar", "identity_class": "events"}' \
'[{"sourceip": "192.0.2.0", "filename": "someFile.exe", "sourceport": "0123", "username": "root"}]' '{"stix_2.1": true}'
```


### Validating STIX 2.0 and 2.1 bundles with the validator script

Refer to the [STIX validator](../bundle_validator/)

### Results translation using an input file

Create a JSON file with the results you wish to translate. The file can be used in the results translation call using standard input.

_results.json_
```
[
    {
        "starttime": "1563892019916",
        "endtime": "1563892019916",
        "sourceip": "9.21.122.127",
        "sourceport": "100",
        "identityip": "0.0.0.0",
        "destinationip": "127.0.0.1",
        "destinationport": "800",
        "username": "admin",
        "protocol": "tcp"
    }
]
```

`python main.py translate qradar results '{"type": "identity","id": "identity--f431f809-377b-45e0-aa1c-6a4751cae5ff","name": "QRadar","identity_class": "system"}' '' < /path/to/file/results.json`

## Transmit

### Connection and Configuration objects

STIX-shifter expects connection and configuration objects to be passed in during transmission calls. The connection object contains the host address and port of the data source being connected to, as well as an optional self signed certificate.

### Connection

This object contains information needed to connect to a specific data source. The `host` and `port` keys are required.

```
{
    "host": <Host URL or IP address>,
    "port": <Port>,
    "selfSignedCert": <false or Certificate>,
    "cert": <Certificate (if required)>,
    "resultSizeLimit": <Results limit to come back from the data source query>,
    "timeRange": <Default query time range in minutes>,
    "options": {<Any required options specific to the particular data source>}
}
```

### Connection Options

These are general options defined in [`config.json`](../stix_shifter_modules/config.json) that can apply to all connectors but may be overwritten by individual modules.

| Option | Description | Accepted Values |
| ------ | ----------- | -------------- |
| timeout | The max amount of time in seconds before the query times out. The default is `30`. | A number between `1` and `60` |


### Configuration

This object contains an `auth` key who's value stores authentication information for the data source. What keys and values get stored in the auth will depend on the authentication requirements of the data source (username, password, auth token, etc).

```
{
    "auth": {
        "username": <Username>,
        "password": <Password>
    }
}
```

```
{
    "auth": {
        "tenant": <Tenant>,
        "clientId": <Client ID>,
        "clientSecret": <Client Secret>
    }
}
```

```
{
    "auth": {
        "SEC": <SEC Token>
    }
}
```

```
{
    "auth": {
        "token": <Security Token>
    }
}
```

```
{
    "auth": {
        "accountId": <Account ID>,
        "apiKey": <API Key>
    }
}
```

### Transmit functions

Transmit offers several functions: `ping`, `query`, `status` (for asynchronous data sources), `results`, `delete` (if supported by the data source), and `is_async`.

Each of the transmit functions takes in common arguments: the module name, the connection object, and the configuration object. The module name refers to the name of the folder in stix-shifter that contains the connector code. The current module names can be found in the [Available Connectors](CONNECTORS.md) table. Information on the [connection and configuration objects](#transmit) can also be found above. Each of the CLI commands can be run from a terminal in the stix-shifter root director.

Any failed transmission function call will return an error in the format of:

`{'success': False, 'error': <Error message reported by API>, 'code': <Error code>}`


### CLI Arguments

| Argument | Description | Accepted Input |
| -------- | ------------ | --------------- |
| TRANSMISSION KEYWORD | The keyword specifiying a function will be used to transmit API calls to the target data source. | `transmit` |
| MODULE NAME | The name of the connector being used. This is the module directory name as it appears in [stix_shifter_modules](../stix_shifter_modules/). | The connector module name |
| CONNECTION OBJECT | This contains the information needed to connect to the target data source, such as host and port. This must be wrapped in quotes to use with the CLI. | A stringified connection object |
| CONFIGURATION OBJECT |  This contains the information needed to authenticate with the target data source, such as username and password. This must be wrapped in quotes to use with the CLI. | A stringified configuration object |
| TRANSMISSION FUNCTION | The transmission function used to communicate with the target data source. | `is_async`, `ping`, `query`, `status`, `results`, `delete` |

### Transmission Functions and Arguments

| Function | Description | Function Argument | Function Returns |
| ------ | --------------------- | ----------- | -------------- |
| is_async | Checks if the connector is asynchronous. | NA | `true` or `false`
| ping | Calls the data source ping API endpont (or equivalent) to see if a connection can be made.| NA | Object containing `success` of `true` or `false` |
| query | Sends a native query string, as translated from the STIX pattern, to target data source API. | Tranlated query string | Query string | Object containing `success` of `true` or `false` and the `search_id`. If the connector is synchronous, the search_id will be the original query string. |
| status | Checks the status of a query. Only used by asynchronous connectors. | The `search_id` returned from the query call | Object continaing `success` of `true` or `false`, `status` of `RUNNING`, `COMPLETED`, `CANCELED`, or `ERROR`, and `progress` with a number indicating the percentage complete. |
| results | Fetches the native results of a completed query. | The `search_id` returned from the query call followed by OFFSET and LENGTH as numbers | A list of JSON results |
| delete | Deletes a query from the target data source | The `search_id` returned from the query call | Object continaing `success` of `true` or `false` |
| results_stix | Fetches the results of a completed query and runs results-to-stix translation. This essentially combines the `results` transmission function with the results translation | The `search_id` returned from the query call, followed by OFFSET and LENGTH as numbers, followed by the stringified STIX identity object. | A bundle of STIX objects. |

### Ping

Uses the data source API to ping the connection.

#### CLI Command

`stix-shifter transmit <MODULE NAME> '<CONNECTION OBJECT>' '<CONFIGURATION OBJECT>' ping`

#### OUTPUT:

`{'success': True}`

### Query

Uses the data source API to submit a query to the connection.

#### CLI Command

`stix-shifter transmit <MODULE NAME> '<CONNECTION OBJECT>' '<CONFIGURATION OBJECT>' query <NATIVE DATA SOURCE QUERY>`

#### OUTPUT:

`{'success': True, 'search_id': <SEARCH ID>}`

An asynchronous data source will typically return a search ID supplied by the API response. In the event where the API doesn't return a search id, such as with a synchronous data source, the search id will be defined in the transmission module.

### Status

Uses the data source API to look up the query status based on the `search_id` that is returned from the query call. This is only used for asynchronous data sources where the results are not returned right after making a query call. If the connector supports, you can specify `metadata` parameter which may contain extra information to make the status api call.

#### CLI Command

`stix-shifter transmit <MODULE NAME> '<CONNECTION OBJECT>' '<CONFIGURATION OBJECT>' status <SEARCH ID> <METADATA(optional)>`

#### OUTPUT:

`{'success': True, 'status': <STATUS>, 'progress': <QUERY PERCENTAGE COMPLETE>}`

The status can be one of: `COMPLETED`, `ERROR`, `CANCELLED`, `TIMEOUT`, or `RUNNING`. Depending on the data source, the progress may return with less than 100 while still showing the status as completed.

### Results

Uses the data source API to fetch the query results based on the search ID, offset, and length. 

If the connector supports, you can specify `metadata` parameter which may contain extra information to fetch the next batch of results from the datasource. This is a recomended parameter for the datasource that supports pagination.

#### CLI Command

`stix-shifter transmit <MODULE NAME> '<CONNECTION OBJECT>' '<CONFIGURATION OBJECT>' results <SEARCH ID> <OFFSET> <LENGTH> <METADATA(optional)>`

The `OFFSET` and `LENGTH` control what pages/rows of data are returned in the query results. 

#### OUTPUT:

`{'success': True, 'data': [<QUERY RESULTS>]}`

#### OUTPUT(with metadata):

`{'success': True, 'data': [<QUERY RESULTS>], 'metadata': <metadata values>}`

#### Example:
```
{
    "success": true,
    "data": [
        {
            "event": {
                "securityEvent": {
                    "eventTimestamp": "2022-06-13T14:36:54.216539700Z",
                    "eventType": "FILE_CREATION",
                    "vendorName": "Microsoft",
                    "productEventType": "DeviceFileEvents",
                    "ingestedTimestamp": "2022-06-13T15:36:26.275010Z"
                },
                "securityResult": [
                    {
                        "summary": "FileCreated",
                        "category": "alert"
                    }
                ]
            }
        }
    ],
    "metadata": {
        "result_count": 2,
        "next_page_token": "CgwIlqLjoAYQ2NfggwESCwiGl52VBhC0xKB"
    }
}
```

### Results as STIX

Uses the data source API to fetch the query results based on the search ID, offset, and length, and transforms into a bundle of STIX objects.

#### CLI Command

`stix-shifter transmit <MODULE NAME> '<CONNECTION OBJECT>' '<CONFIGURATION OBJECT>' results_stix <SEARCH ID> <OFFSET> <LENGTH> '<STIX IDENTITY OBJECT>'`

#### OUTPUT:

STIX bundle of objects.

The `OFFSET` and `LENGTH` control what pages/rows of data are returned in the query results.

### Is Async

Checks if the data source connection is asynchronous.

#### CLI Command

`stix-shifter transmit <MODULE NAME> '<CONNECTION OBJECT>' '<CONFIGURATION OBJECT>' is_async`

#### OUTPUT:

`True` or `False`

## Execute

The `execute` command tests all steps of the translation-transmission flow:

1. A STIX pattern is translated into a list of one or more native data source queries (using a **translate query** call).
2. Each translated query in the list is sent to the data source via a **transmit query** call.
3. If the data source is asynchronous, a **transmit status** call is made for each query. Otherwise the flow moves to the next step.
4. A **transmit results** call is made for each query (using the returned query ID in step 2). If data is returned, the resulting JSON objects get added to a list.
5. The list of JSON results get translated into a bundle of STIX objects with a **translate query** call. This bundle includes the STIX `identity` object and `observed-data` objects.

### CLI Arguments

| Argument | Description | Accepted Input |
| -------- | ------------ | --------------- |
| EXECUTE KEYWORD | The keyword specifiying that the execute function will be used. | `execute` |
| TRANSMISSION MODULE NAME | The name of the connector being used for transmission functions. This is the module directory name as it appears in [stix_shifter_modules](../stix_shifter_modules/). | The connector module name |
| TRANSLATION MODULE NAME | The name of the connector being used for translation functions. This is the module directory name as it appears in [stix_shifter_modules](../stix_shifter_modules/). | The connector module name |
| STIX IDENTITY OBJECT | This is an object that represents the data source being queried and is inserted into the results bundle of STIX objects. An empty object `"{}"` may be used for the query translation. This must be wrapped in quotes to use with the CLI. | A stringified STIX identity object |
| CONNECTION OBJECT | This contains the information needed to connect to the target data source, such as host and port. This must be wrapped in quotes to use with the CLI. | A stringified connection object |
| CONFIGURATION OBJECT |  This contains the information needed to authenticate with the target data source, such as username and password. This must be wrapped in quotes to use with the CLI. | A stringified configuration object |
| STIX PATTERN | This is the STIX pattern to be used for the query. This must be wrapped in quote to use with the CLI. | A stringified STIX pattern |

### Connection Object Options

These are general options defined in [`config.json`](../stix_shifter_modules/config.json) that can apply to all connectors but may be overwritten by individual modules. These should be added as an "options" objects inside the CONNECTION OBJECT.

| Option | Function Type | Description | Accepted Values |
| ------ | --------------------- | ----------- | -------------- |
| result_limit | query translation | The max number of results that can be returned from a query. This value is generally included in translated queries before getting sent to the data source's API query call. The default is `10000` | A number between `1` and `500000` |
| time_range | query translation | A default time range, in minutes, applied to the translated query when no `START STOP` qualifier is present in the STIX pattern. As an example, this would be the `last x minutes` in a SQL query. The default is `5` | A number between `1` and `10000` |
| dialects | query translation | Dialects to be used for pattern translation. This will determine what `from_stix_map.json` files will be used. | A list of one or more dialect strings supported by the connector |
| validate_pattern | query translation | Specifies if pattern validation is run during the query translation call. This can catch errors in the submitted STIX pattern that would otherwise raise exceptions during translation. | `true` or `false` |
| unmapped_fallback | results translation | If set to `true`, any results data returned, that is not specifired in the to-STIX mapping, will be included in the results in the following STIX object:property format `x-<MODULE NAME>:<NATIVE DATA FIELD>`. The default is `false` | `true` or `false` |
| stix_2.1 | results translation | Results are returned as STIX 2.0 objects by default. Setting this option will return results in STIX 2.1 format. The default is `false` | `true` or `false` |
| timeout | transmission | The max amount of time in seconds before the query times out. The default is `30`. | A number between `1` and `60` |


### CLI Command

`stix-shifter execute <TRANSMISSION MODULE NAME> <TRANSLATION MODULE NAME> '<STIX IDENTITY OBJECT>' '<CONNECTION OBJECT>' '<CONFIGURATION OBJECT>' '<STIX PATTERN>'`

### CLI Example

`stix-shifter execute mysql mysql '{"type": "identity","id": "identity--f431f809-377b-45e0-aa1c-6a4751cae5ff","name": "mysql","identity_class": "system"}' '{"host": "localhost", "database":"demo_db", "options":{"table":"demo_table", "validate_pattern": true}}' '{"auth": {"username":"root", "password":"MyPassword"}}' "[ipv4-addr:value = '213.213.142.5'] START t'2019-01-28T12:24:01.009Z' STOP t'2019-01-28T12:54:01.009Z'"`

### Debug

You can add the `--debug` option to your CLI command to see more logs. 

`stix-shifter --debug execute <TRANSMISSION MODULE NAME> <TRANSLATION MODULE NAME> '<STIX IDENTITY OBJECT>' '<CONNECTION OBJECT>' '<CONFIGURATION OBJECT>' '<STIX PATTERN>'` 

### Change max returned results

You can add the `--results` option with an integer value at the end of your CLI command to limit the maximum number of returned search results (default 10).

`stix-shifter execute <TRANSMISSION MODULE NAME> <TRANSLATION MODULE NAME> '<STIX IDENTITY OBJECT>' '<CONNECTION OBJECT>' '<CONFIGURATION OBJECT>' '<STIX PATTERN>' --results 50`

### Save the STIX results to a file

You can redirect the output of your CLI command to a file to save the STIX results.

`stix-shifter execute <TRANSMISSION MODULE NAME> <TRANSLATION MODULE NAME> '<STIX IDENTITY OBJECT>' '<CONNECTION OBJECT>' '<CONFIGURATION OBJECT>' '<STIX PATTERN>' > results.json`

### OUTPUT:

A bundle of STIX objects

## Modules

The `modules` command will return a JSON of the existing connectors along with their dialects and supported languages that are used in query translation. 

### CLI Command

`python main.py modules`

#### output
```
{
    "qradar": {
        "flows": {
            "language": "stix",
            "default": true
        },
        "events": {
            "language": "stix",
            "default": true
        },
        "aql": {
            "language": "aql",
            "default": false
        }
    },
    "security_advisor": {
        "default": {
            "language": "stix",
            "default": true
        }
    },
    ...
}
```

This command can also be used to get the dialects of a specific connector.

`python main.py modules <module name>`

### CLI Command

`python main.py modules qradar`

#### output
```
{
    "qradar": {
        "flows": {
            "language": "stix",
            "default": true
        },
        "events": {
            "language": "stix",
            "default": true
        },
        "aql": {
            "language": "aql",
            "default": true
        }
    }
}
```

In the above example, the QRadar connector can use three dialects: `flows`, `events`, and `aql`. When a connector only has a `default` dialect, such as with Security Advisor, only one dialect is used by the connector. Most dialects will use the `stix` language since they translate STIX patterns into native queries. QRadar's `aql` dialect uses the `aql` language since it is meant to accept an AQL query rather than a STIX pattern. See the [QRadar connector README](../stix_shifter_modules/qradar/README.md) for more information on AQL passthrough.

## configs

The `configs` command returns the configuration pararmetes of the existing connectors. It basically returns a JSON of the existing connectors along with their connections and configuation objects that are specified in config.json.

### CLI Command

`python main.py configs`
#### output
```
{
    "alertflex": {
        "connection": {
            "type": {
                "type": "connectorType",
                "displayName": "Alertflex"
            },
            "options": {
                "type": "fields",
                "async_call": {
                    "type": "text",
                    "hidden": true,
                    "optional": true
                },
                "result_limit": {
                    "default": 10000,
                    "min": 1,
                    "max": 500000,
                    "type": "number",
                    "previous": "connection.resultSizeLimit"
                },
                "time_range": {
                    "default": 5,
                    "min": 1,
                    "max": 10000,
                    "type": "number",
                    "previous": "connection.timerange",
                    "nullable": true
                },
                .....
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Specifying the connector module name will return the configuration parameters of a specific connector.

## Limitations

STIX-Shifter has limitations on the length of a pattern that can be translated into a native query. As the pattern length increases, the translation time increases exponentially due to how ANTLR 4 parses the pattern. See [STIX-Shifter Limitations](stix-shifter-limitations.md) for more details.
