### Introduction

STIX-shifter is an open source python library allowing software to connect to products that house data repositories by using STIX Patterning, and return results as STIX Observations.

## Installation

The recommended method for installing the STIX-shifter is via pip.

```
pip install stix-shifter
```

## Usage


### As A Script

The STIX-Shifter comes with a bundled script which you can use to translate STIX Pattern to a native datasource query. It can also be used to translate a JSON data source query result to a STIX bundle of observable objects. You can also send query to a datasource by using a transmission option. 

More details of the command line option can be found [here](https://github.com/opencybersecurityalliance/stix-shifter/blob/master/OVERVIEW.md#how-to-use)

```
$ stix-shifter translate <MODULE NAME> query "<STIX IDENTITY OBJECT>" "<STIX PATTERN>" "<OPTIONS>"
```
Example:
```
$ stix-shifter translate qradar query {} "[ipv4-addr:value = '127.0.0.1']" {}
```

**Note:** In order to create python executable `stix-shifter` from source run the following command from stix-shifter parent directory in your python 3 environment: `python setup.py install`

### As A Library

You can also use this library to integrate STIX Shifter into your own tools. You can translate a STIX Pattern:

```
from stix_shifter.stix_translation import stix_translation

translation = stix_translation.StixTranslation()
response = translation.translate('<MODULE NAME>', 'query', '{}', '<STIX PATTERN>', '<OPTIONS>')

print(response)
```
