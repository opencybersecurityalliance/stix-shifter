# stix-shifter

This project consists of an open source library allowing software to connect to data repositories using STIX Patterning, and return results as STIX Observations.

Requires Python 3.6

## Converting from STIX Patterns to data source queries

### Call the stix_shifter in the format of

```
usage: stix_shifter.py translate [-h]
                                 {qradar,dummy}
                                 {results,query} data

positional arguments:
  {qradar,dummy}         What translation module to use
  {results,query}                        What translation action to perform
  data source                            A STIX identity object
  data                                   The data to be translated

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -x                    run STIX validation on each observable as it's written to the output JSON
```

### Example of converting a STIX pattern to an AQL query:

[See the QRadar module documentation](stix_shifter/src/modules/qradar/README.md)

### Example of converting QRadar events to STIX:

[See the QRadar module documentation](stix_shifter/src/modules/qradar/README.md)

## Creating new translator modules

To create a new module that can be used when importing stix-shifter, follow these steps:

- Create a directory with the name of your module in the `stix-shifter/src/modules/` directory
- In `stix-shifter.py`, add `<module-name>` to the `MODULES` array at the top of the file
- In your module directory, create a new python code file named `<module-name>_translator.py`. This is where you'll be defining your concrete translator class
  - In `<module-name>_translator.py`, define a class named `Translator` and have it extend `BaseTranslator` from `stix-shifter/src/modules/base/base_translator.py`. (You can use `stix-shifter/src/modules/dummy/dummy_translator.py` as an example)
  - In `__init__` you need to assign `self.result_translator` and `self.query_translator` to the appropriate query and result translator you want your module to use. For example the QRadar translator uses `JSONToStix` as its result translator and `StixToAQL` as its query translator
  - You can write your own query and result translators as well, they must be based off of `BaseQueryTranslator` and `BaseResultTranslator` found in `stix-shifter/src/modules/base/`. Again, you can use the dummy module as a decent example on how to setup the concrete classes found in `stix-shifter/src/modules/dummy/`
- Once you have this all set up you can invoke your module by running `stix_shifter.py` and passing in your translator module name as the first parameter. The second parameter `query or result` determines if your module runs the query or result translator. The third parameter `data` is passed into your translator as the data that will be translated. If you've imported `stix_shifter.py` into other python code, you can invoke it by running the `translate(module, translation_type, data)` method
- IMPORTANT: If you're including any json data files in your module, be sure to include the path in `MANIFEST.in` so that it's included in the packaging
