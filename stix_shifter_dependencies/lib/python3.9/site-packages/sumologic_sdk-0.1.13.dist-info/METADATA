Sumo Logic Python SDK
=====================

Community-supported Python interface to the Sumo Logic REST API.  The idea is to make it easier to
hit the API in Python code.  Sample scripts available in the `scripts` folder.  Please submit issues
here via Github.  Do not submit customer issues to Sumo Logic support (but REST API issues are of 
course supported).
