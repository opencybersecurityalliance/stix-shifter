    "# STIX-Shifter CLI Quick Lab\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "STIX (Structured Threat Information eXpression) is a JSON structure used to share cybersecurity threat intelligence. STIX-shifter is an open-source python library that is part of the Open Cybersecurity Alliance. It allows data repositories to be queried using STIX patterning and return the results as STIX cyber observable objects. This lab will allow users to test out the various stix-shifter CLI commands.\n",
    "\n",
    "### STIX Patterning\n",
    "\n",
    "A [STIX pattern](http://docs.oasis-open.org/cti/stix/v2.0/cs01/part5-stix-patterning/stix-v2.0-cs01-part5-stix-patterning.html) is used to query [cyber observable objects](https://docs.oasis-open.org/cti/stix/v2.0/stix-v2.0-part4-cyber-observable-objects.html). STIX patterns take the format of:\n",
    "\n",
    "`[<OBJECT>:<PROPERTY> = 'some value' AND <OBJECT>:<PROPERTY> IN (value_1, value_2)] OR [<OBJECT>:<PROPERTY> = 'some value']`\n",
    "\n",
    "The `[ ]` represents one observation. A pattern can have multiple observations joined by the AND or OR observation operators. An observation can be thought of as one instance or row of data. Within the observation is one or more comparison expressions that looks for a value associated to a cyber observable STIX object and its property. This is a sample pattern with one observation containing an comparison operation for an IP lookup: `[ipv4-addr:value = '1.2.3.4']`. The STIX object in this case is `ipv4-addr` and the property on that object is `value`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### STIX Observed Data\n",
    "\n",
    "STIX-shifter returns a `bundle` of STIX `observed-data` objects. The bundle is a container object to hold the results. Below is a sample bundle containing one identity object (representing the data source) and one observed-data object:\n",
