# BigFix UDS Connector

## BigFix Relevance Query with XML schema:

The actual relevance query is wrapped around by XML tag `<QueryText> query string </QueryText>` while calling the BigFix api-

```
<BESAPI xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation="BESAPI.xsd"> 
	<ClientQuery>
	<ApplicabilityRelevance>true</ApplicabilityRelevance>
	<QueryText>( name of it | "n/a", process id of it as string | "n/a", sha256 of image file of it | "n/a", pathname of image file of it | "n/a" ) of processes</QueryText>
	<Target>
		<CustomRelevance>true</CustomRelevance>
	</Target>
	</ClientQuery>
</BESAPI>
```

## Example STIX pattern for file query:

#### STIX patterns:

  1. `[file:parent_directory_ref.path = '/root']`
  2. `[file:name LIKE '.conf' AND file:parent_directory_ref.path = '/etc']`
  3. `[file:hashes.'SHA-256' = '2584c4ba8b0d2a52d94023f420b7e356a1b1a3f2211111111111122222222333' AND file:parent_directory_ref.path = '/root']`
  4. `[file:name = 'a' AND file:parent_directory_ref.path = '/root' OR file:hashes.'SHA-256' = '2584c4ba8b0d2a52d94023f420b7e356a1b1a3000000444446666666']`
  
  `Note: file:parent_directory_ref.path attribute will support Equality operation only.`

#### Translated relevance query(in the same order as STIX patterns):

  1. `("file", name of it | "n/a",  "sha256", sha256 of it | "n/a",  "sha1", sha1 of it | "n/a",  "md5", md5 of it | "n/a",  pathname of it | "n/a",  size of it | 0,  (modification time of it - "01 Jan 1970 00:00:00 +0000" as time)/second) of files whose ((modification time of it is greater than or equal to "10 Jan 2013 08:43:10 +0000" as time AND modification time of it is less than or equal to "23 Oct 2019 10:43:10 +0000" as time)) of folder "/root"`
